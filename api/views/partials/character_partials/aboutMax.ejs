                Max was once the highest ranking knight of his country. As life would have it, he eventually grew too old to maintain that merit. In order to still be able to fight for his motherland, he started inventing mechanical weapons and body parts to take over after the decayed ones. He hunts for the golden die in order to feel the rush of proper battle again - just like in the good old days.
