                    The main feature of Dice Chronicles is the strategic, gamble-based battles using dice. 
                    Each hero has their own unique set of 6 dice that's used for building combos and racking up damage.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Short version: 
                    <br>
                    Try to get combinations of dice you can see in the table (Under <a href="#eDiv">Example</a> below). Everything not resulting in "0" is a valid combination. You can roll as many times as you want, but you have to save at least one die after each throw. If you have a combination that gives 0 points at the end of your turn, you receive the rest of the damage you have accumulated yourself. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Longer version: 
                    <br>
                    During your turn, you can roll as many times as you want, as long as you are able to store/save at least one die after each roll. 
                    If you manage to build a valid combo with all six dice, you may start over again, keeping and increasing your accumulated damage. 
                    You can also choose to roll the dice of a different hero in your team for the next round, trying to achieve <a href="/dice_battle_team_attacks"> team combos</a>
                    or maybe play a little safer. Theoretically, you can always accumulate enough damage to one-hit-KO your opponent, 
                    but going for it would be a huge gamble, as we will soon see. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There are two ways in which your turn may end:<br>
                    1: You choose to end your turn<br>
                    <!-- 2: After your last roll (or rather after saving at least one die after your last roll), you are unable to (use all your saved dice in a valid combo.<br> -->
                    2: Your turn ends due to the effect of items or status conditions
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    If all your saved dice are part of a combo when your turn ends, you attack your opponent and deal the accumulated damage. 
                    If there are saved dice that are not part of a combo (a “stray die”), your opponent counterattacks, and you receive all the accumulated damage yourself. 
                    (Items and status conditions may affect this in different ways, but this is the main principle). 
                    <br>

                <h2>Example 1:</h2>
                <br>

                <p>
                    This is Mias table. It's always available to look at if you need it. Again: Everything not resulting in 0 points is considered a valid "combo". For example three waves, one foot and one hand would result in 650 points and be considered valid. Two waves, three hands and two feet would not be valid, because two waves give 0 damage(You need three or more).
                </p>
                <img src="/images/MiasFirstRoll.png">
                <p>
                    Here is Mias first roll. The only "combo" we have now is one hand for 50 damage. That's too little if you ask me. I'd rather save the two waves and hope to get another one later. I can roll as many times as I want to as long as I store at least one die after each roll. For now, I'll only save the two waves. (The waterfalls also give 500 points, but the waves give my opponent a status condition earlier, as we can see from the table)
                </p>
                <img src="/images/MiasSecondRoll.png">
                <p>
                   Ops, scary... No wave here. Luckily, we have a foot which is always a valid combo (It never results in 0). We'll save that and hope for the best on our next roll.
                </p>
                <img src="/images/MiasThirdRoll.png">
                <p>
                    Wow! Talk about luck! Not only did we get wave that we needed - we also got more feet. Now, all our saved dice are valid, which means that we deal the accumulated damage to our opponent if we choose to end our turn (Reminder: You can always end tour turn after storing on die, no matter how many you have saved. You may end your turn with only one saved die if you want to!).
                </p>
                <img src="/images/MiasChoice.png">
                <p>
                    We can choose to end our turn here and deal 800 points to our opponent. Because we managed to use all our six dice, we can also roll all six again. We could for example roll with Sarah next, trying to give a second status condition and pull off a team attack. For now, let's just end our turn and get some damage on the board.
                </p>
                <!--<img src="/images/6.png">
                <p>
                    Ooops… Should not have done that. We have to save at least one die after each roll before we can end our turn. 
                    As we can see from the table, we are unable to make a combo out of any of the remaining dice. 
                    Our combos failed, and we receive the 700 damage instead. Should have played it safe this time…
                </p>!-->
                <h2>Example 2:</h2>
                <br>
                <img src="/images/SimonsTable.png">
                <p>
                    This is Simons table. You can access the tables from the question mark to the right of the damage calculations.
                </p>
                <img src="/images/SimonsFirstRoll.png">
                <p>
                    This is Simons first roll. We got one tornado. Let's hope we can make that three in the following turns. We'll save it and roll again. I could also have saved the hand and foot, since they too are valid. If I did that though, I would have had fewer dice to get the rest of my tornados on. That is why I only take the one tornado from now. 
                </p>
                <img src="/images/SimonsSecondRoll.png">
                <p>
                   Ouch... No tornados and no hands nor feet to help us out. Our only options now are either to try for: 
                   <br>
                   - Straight
                   <br>
                   - Three pairs
                   <br>
                   - Three tornados and three of something else. 
                   <br>
                   If we save two "heavy wind" now, we have the opportunity to get either Three pairs or 3+3 later, so we'll do that. 
                </p>
                <img src="/images/SimonsThirdRoll.png">
                <p>
                   Okay, we got the tornado at least! Let's save that and roll again.
                </p>
                <img src="/images/SimonsFourthRoll.png">
                <p>
                   Okay, now we're in quite the predicament... 3 + 3 is off the table. We have to save the foot or the cloud, meaning there are not enough dice for both a tornado and "heavy wind". We could still try for Three pairs, though. Then it would be wise to save the cloud, because that gives 0 damage if it fails, while the foot gives 100. So we save the cloud.
                </p>
                <img src="/images/SimonsEnd.png">
                <p>
                    Okay, now what? Here, it comes down to our courage and luck. We have a 1/6 chance of getting the cloud we need. We have 2/6 chance of getting a third tornado or "heavy wind" which will make us lose 600 or 400 damage ourselves. (All accumulated damage are returned to us if we have any invalid combos in our saved dice). For now, let's just call it quits. If I were playing myself, I would definately have taken the risk and tried, but I wanted to take the opportunity to show how to tactically end your turn and minimize losses as well, if you are not a risk-lover like me.
